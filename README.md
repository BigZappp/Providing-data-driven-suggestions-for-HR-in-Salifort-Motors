The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to me as a data analytics professional and ask me to provide data-driven suggestions based on my understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If i can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

In my deliverables, I included the model evaluation and interpretation, a data visualization that is directly related to the question asked, ethical considerations, and the resources i used to troubleshoot and find answers and solutions.
